# Pokedex React
This is the first item added to the list of projects at the end of my Frontend journey. Here you will find a project that uses the React JS framework (https://react.dev/). The project is a Pokedex, everything is connected to an API (the info about it is in the code of this project). As in the Pokemon series, the Pokedex gathers here all the main information (ID, name of the pokemon, type(s) of the pokemon and its stats as well as its image).

## How to launch the project ?

Open the folder in your IDE (Visual Studio Code for example) and follow the instructions below:

### `The command prompt`

Open the terminal of your IDE (on VSC by pressing CTRL + Ã¹ or by clicking on "Terminal" and then on "New terminal")

### `The command`

Once the terminal is open you just have to write the following command: npm start

You need Node JS to install on your computer: https://nodejs.org/en

### `Reminder`

It is important to remember that to execute this command you must open the folder corresponding to this project.
